<h1>Number Guessing Game</h1>
<p>Pick a number between 0 to 1000. Remember it but don't tell me. I guarantee to guess it in 10 guesses or less
provided you don't change your number and answer my questions truthfully.</p> <br>
<p> I will make a series of guesses. After each guess tell me if my guess is too high or too low or correct.
The game ends when the guess is equal to your number.</p> <br>
